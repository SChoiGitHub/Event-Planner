##Team 8: Event Planner
This repository houses the source code for an Event Planning & Personal  
Availability application. Team 1 is currently in the process of reviewing  
the code the has been passed on from Team 8. Our intent is to have the  
application satisfy all Project 1 requirements on or before Sunday, 2-20-18.


###Easiest Route to a Compiled Program
* Clone the [Project-Setup](https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner/tree/Project-Setup) branch.  
 * Clone URL: https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner.git
* Make sure to use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15).  
 * Run `EventPlanner.sln`

`EventPlanner.sln` will generate a Visual Studio project with all of the  
correct dependencies, paths and libraries set.

####Following these steps _should_ generate a project that will compile.
