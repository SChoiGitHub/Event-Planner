This program was build for and tested on Linux systems.

Features in this program come from C++11 and as such C++11 is required to build the program.
The boost library is used within this program. You will need to have it downloaded and installed to build this program. The preferred location for the library is in the ./lib directory.

This program can be built from the makefile in the source directory. If boost is not installed in the preferred directory, you may change the path to the library in the makefile by editing the path after "lib =". LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to the path of the compiled boost library.

Documentation on the classes is easily accessed in "./documentation/html/classes.html", where one can see all the classes and links to other html files for more information. Documentation is generated by Doxygen.
