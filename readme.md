This application is to help people schedule events.

To compile and run the applications, you must build Boost C++ into the source folder and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the library folder of the newly built Boost C++. The "make" command should be run from the source folder during compilation using the existing "makefile".

Documentation on the classes is easily accessed in "./documentation/html/classes.html", where one can see all the classes and links to other html files for more information. Documentation is generated by Doxygen.
