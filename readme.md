## Team 8: Event Planner: Project-Setup
This branch repackages the source code we have inherited. I feel like we  
should be able to clone this branch and then branch off of that. For example 
I might create a branch called Fix-TimeSlots to change how timeslots are selected  
then merge that back in.

Availability application. Team 1 is currently in the process of reviewing  
the code the has been passed on from Team 8. Our intent is to have the
