## Team 8: Event Planner: Project-Setup
This branch repackages the source code we have inherited. I feel like we  
should be able to clone this branch and then branch off of that. For example 
I might create a branch called Fix-TimeSlots to change how timeslots are selected  
then merge that back in.


### Easiest Route to a Compiled Program
* Clone the [Project-Setup](https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner/tree/Project-Setup) branch.  
 * Clone URL: https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner.git
* Make sure to use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15).  
 * Run `EventPlanner.sln`

`EventPlanner.sln` will generate a Visual Studio project with all of the  
correct dependencies, paths and libraries set.

#### Following these steps _should_ generate a project that will compile.
