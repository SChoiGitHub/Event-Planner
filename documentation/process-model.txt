The ideal software process model for the project is the V-Model. The V-Model is best because the requirements are well defined at the start of development. Agile models are not ideal since the customers are unable to give feedback consistently. The V-Model was chosen over the Waterfall model because the V-Model is more flexible between iterations after code-generation. The V-Model was chosen over the Spiral model because risk-assessment is not emphasized in the project. The V-Model was chosen over Prototyping model because the customer has given clear requirements at the beginning.
