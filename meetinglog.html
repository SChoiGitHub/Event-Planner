        <left><h4>Goals:</h4></left>
        <p style="max-width: 650px;">This was a less-than-official meeting. We gathered in Shutz library.
            The primary goal was to perform a brief analysis of Team 8's Project
            1 code to see what features were missing that we should implement as
            well as determine what bugs if any exist.</p>
        <left><h4>Goals Accomplished:</h4></left>
        <p style="max-width: 650px;">The primary goal of the meeting was not accomplished.
            Our team has no experience compiling C++ with external libraries, nor with
            complex makefiles so we spent a great deal of time trying to determine how
            to compile the code so that we could test it. After a few hours of reviewing
            references and some naive makefile trial and error it was decided that the best
            course of action would be to consult with Kurt Slagle tomorrow(2-20-18).</p>
        <left><h4>TODO:</h4></left>
        <p style="max-width: 650px;">
            <ol>
                <li>Establish rules for meeting preparation and participation.</li>
                <li>Determine a meeting facilitator.</li>
                <li>Research external libraries with C++, makefiles, linking, etc.</li>
                <li>Contact Kurt tomorrow(2-20-18) for a more expeditious solution.</li>
                <li>Attend meeting on 2-20-18.</li>
            <ol></p>
